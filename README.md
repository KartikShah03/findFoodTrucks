# findFoodTrucks
Application primarily to search food trucks at near by location, open at that time.
The application is developed completely on UI technologies. However, for data, API is called using http service.
Application is developed using Angular Js framework, HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap for UI, also SASS is used, which help us prepare css files.
For locating, geolocation service is used.
Had enough of time, I would have made it more UI rich, using number of components of bootstrap and animated CSS. Also, gulp task would be used to run application, minify the source code and run the application over node. Also better data validation would have been done, which help us provide exact data.
This is a simple web application. Kindly run index.html file in crome to run the application.
